Problem:
On a golf course there are _n_ balls and _n_ holes, _n_ golfers want to simultaneuosly place each ball into any of the holes. In order to do that, they arrange between themselves, who is aiming which hole, but in a way that any ball trajectory does not intersect with another. It guarantees lack of collisions.

Given that balls and holes are points on a surface, any three of them are collinear and ball trajectories are segments of straight lines, present the algorithm assigning balls to holes, which will guarantee that any two of ball trajectories are not intersecting. The algorithm should have <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?O(n^2\log%20n)" /> time complexity.
